# Taxi Data Analysis Project

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of taxi order and offer data using Python and the pandas library. It includes data cleaning, merging datasets, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations using Matplotlib and Folium.

## 🚀 Features

- Load and inspect large datasets
- Handle missing values and transform columns
- Merge order and offer data
- Derive new insights (e.g., order time by hour, cancellation status)
- Visualize patterns in ride cancellations
- Create interactive maps with Folium

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- folium

## 📁 Dataset

- `data_orders.csv`: Contains taxi order data with timestamps, geolocation, and driver assignment.
- `data_offers.csv`: Contains offers linked to specific orders.

## 📊 Analysis Highlights

- Cancellation reason analysis (Client vs System)
- Time-based behavior (peak cancellation hours)
- Visualization of order origins on an interactive map
- Pivot table reports for summarized insights
